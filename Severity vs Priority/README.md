# Understand Severity vs Priority

Severity is typically determined by QA or technical personnel based on the impact on functionality.

Priority is often decided by business stakeholders, such as Business Analysts (BA) or Product Owners (PO), based on business needs and urgency.

## Severity Levels:

### Critical:

> **_Users are unable to complete the checkout process, leading to a significant financial loss for the business._**

### Major:

> **_In an e-commerce application, the search functionality returns inaccurate results, affecting the user experience but not causing immediate financial loss._**

### Moderate:

> **_Registration for a service is possible, but users do not receive a confirmation email. This impacts user communication but does not prevent core functionality._**

### Minor:

> **_A minor typo in a notification message that doesn't affect functionality but may impact user perception._**

## Priority Levels:

### Critical and Urgent:

> **_A critical bug that prevents users from logging in, and it is considered urgent because it affects a key functionality._**

### Critical but Non-Urgent:

> **_A rarely used feature is not working as intended. While it is critical, it may not be urgent as it doesn't impact essential operations immediately._**

### Non-Critical and Urgent:

> **_The company logo displays in the wrong color on the website, impacting branding. While not critical, it's urgent to maintain the company's image._**

### Non-Critical and Non-Urgent:

> **_The caption for an image is written in the wrong font. It doesn't affect functionality, and it's not urgent to fix._**

## [In Summary]

Understanding and correctly assigning severity and priority levels are crucial for effective bug triage and ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly while considering the overall impact on the business.
