# Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of three primary roles:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team.

> Therefore, when referring to the Scrum Team in the context of the Sprint Review, it includes all three of these roles.

<br>

Here's a brief overview of the roles within the Scrum Team:

### Product Owner:

The Product Owner is responsible for representing the interests of the stakeholders, maintaining and prioritizing the Product Backlog, and ensuring that the Development Team delivers value to meet business objectives.

<br>

### Scrum Master:

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team, facilitating Scrum events, removing impediments, and coaching the team to improve its processes and effectiveness.

In essence, a servant-leader, in the context of Scrum, places the needs of the Scrum Team above their own, facilitating the team's success and growth.

> The emphasis is on serving the team by **_providing support, guidance, and removing impediments_**, all while leading in a way that empowers and enables the team to reach its full potential.

<br>

### Development Team:

The Development Team is a cross-functional group of professionals responsible for delivering the product increment during a Sprint. It includes roles such as **_programmers, QA engineers, designers, and others_** necessary to complete the work.

## What does Scrum Team do during Sprint Review?

So, during the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team collectively refers to the **_Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the entire Development Team._**

Additionally, stakeholders, including customers, end-users, and executives, are invited to the Sprint Review to observe the demonstrated increment, provide feedback, and collaborate with the Scrum Team.

> The Sprint Review is an opportunity for the Scrum Team and stakeholders to engage in open communication, discuss what was done during the Sprint, and collectively plan the next steps based on feedback and priorities.
