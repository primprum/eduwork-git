# How do professional create test cases

> In a professional workplace, the process of creating test cases can vary based on the development and testing methodologies used by the organization.

Some common approaches:

## Test Case Management Tools

Many organizations use dedicated test case management tools such as Jira, TestRail, or Zephyr.
These tools provide a structured environment to create, organize, and manage test cases.
Test cases can be documented, linked to requirements or user stories, and tracked for execution status.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD is a methodology that involves collaboration between developers, QA, and business stakeholders. It often uses tools like Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behave, which allow writing test scenarios in a Gherkin language. These tools can then be integrated with programming languages to automate tests based on these scenarios.

## Excel or Spreadsheet Software

In some cases, especially in smaller teams or when formal test case management tools are not in use, test cases might be written and managed in spreadsheets such as Excel. Each row in the spreadsheet represents a test case with columns for test steps, expected results, and other relevant information.

## Manual Test Scripts

Test cases can be written as manual test scripts with step-by-step instructions on how to execute the test. These scripts can include details such as preconditions, steps to be performed, and expected results. Manual testing tools or documentation platforms may be used for managing these scripts.

## Agile Tools and User Stories

In Agile environments, test cases are often closely tied to user stories or tasks. Teams may write test scenarios directly within the user stories and use tools like Jira or Azure DevOps to manage both development and testing tasks.

## [Summary]

> The choice of method often depends on the organization's processes, the size of the team, the nature of the project, and the tools available. It's essential to have a systematic and organized way to manage and execute test cases to ensure comprehensive testing and efficient collaboration among team members
