# STLC (Requirement Analysis)

Requirement Analysis in STLC involves:

> **_understanding and analyzing the software requirements to determine testing needs and establish the testing scope._**

<br>

### (Example) Online Shopping System

Let's consider an online shopping system as the software under development.

<br>

The business requirements might include the following:

#### [User Registration]

Users should be able to create accounts on the platform by providing necessary information such as name, email, and password.

#### [Product Catalog]

The system should display a catalog of products with details such as product name, description, price, and availability status.

#### [Shopping Cart]

Users should be able to add products to their shopping cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.

#### [Order Processing]

The system should process orders by capturing user details, updating inventory, and generating order confirmation.

<br>

### What testing team do during Requirement Analysis?

#### Review Requirements:

Thoroughly review the business requirements to understand the functionality and features of the online shopping system.

#### Identify Test Scenarios:

Based on the requirements, identify various test scenarios that need to be tested. For example:

**[Test scenario 1]** <br>
Verify that users can successfully register on the platform.

**[Test scenario 2]** <br>
Verify that the product catalog displays accurate information.

**[Test scenario 3]** <br>
Verify that users can add products to the shopping cart and proceed to checkout.

#### Determine Testing Types:

Decide on the types of testing needed. For example:

**[Functional Testing]** <br>
To ensure that the system functions according to the specified requirements.

**[Usability Testing]** <br>
To assess the user-friendliness of the registration and checkout processes.

**[Performance Testing]** <br>
To evaluate the system's response time during peak shopping periods.

#### Define Testing Scope:

Determine the scope of testing by specifying the features and functionalities that will be included in the testing process.

In this case, the focus might be on user registration, product catalog, and order processing.

#### Prepare Test Data:

Identify and prepare the necessary test data, such as valid and invalid user registration details, products for testing the shopping cart, and simulated order data.

### Summary (Requirement Analysis)

> Testing team ensures a clear understanding of what needs to be tested and lays the foundation for creating detailed test plans and test cases in the subsequent phases of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
