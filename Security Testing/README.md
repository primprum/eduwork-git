## Understanding Security Testing

Security testing is a type of non-functional testing that focuses on evaluating the security aspects of a software application.

The primary objective of security testing is to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

Here are some examples of security testing:

### Vulnerability Assessment:

Identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in the application's infrastructure, code, and configurations.
Example: Use automated tools and manual analysis to scan the application for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations.

<br>

### Penetration Testing (Pen Testing):

Simulate real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

**Example:**

> Ethical hackers or security experts attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the application, network, or system to understand potential risks and weaknesses.

<br>

### Authentication and Authorization Testing:

Verify the effectiveness of the authentication and authorization mechanisms in place to ensure that only authorized users have access to specific functionalities and data.

**Example:**

> Test different authentication scenarios, including password policies, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control to ensure proper user authentication and authorization.

<br>

### Data Security Testing:

Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data by testing how the application handles, stores, and processes data.

**Example:**

> Assess encryption mechanisms, data storage practices, and data transmission security to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

<br>

### Session Management Testing:

Evaluate the security of user sessions to prevent issues like session hijacking or session fixation.

**Example:**

> Test the application's handling of session tokens, session timeouts, and session regeneration to ensure that user sessions are secure and cannot be easily compromised.

<br>

### Security Compliance Testing:

Verify that the application complies with relevant security standards, regulations, and best practices.

**Example:**

> Conduct an audit to ensure that the application adheres to industry-specific security standards (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, GDPR for data protection) and follows security best practices.

<br>

### Security Patching and Updates Testing:

Ensure that the application remains secure by testing the timely application of security patches and updates.

**Example:**

> Test the application after applying security patches to identify any issues introduced by the updates and ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed.
