# Understand STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

In here, let's try to understand what is STLC and how does it compared to SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

<br>

### Definition:

A systematic approach to planning, designing, executing, and managing software testing activities throughout the software development process.

### STLC Goal:

To identify defects in the software and ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements and quality standards.

### SDLC vs STLC

#### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):

> A framework that outlines the development process of software from its conception to its delivery and maintenance.
>
> It encompasses various phases, including requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

#### STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle):

> STLC focuses specifically on the testing aspects within the broader context of SDLC.
>
> It is a subset of SDLC that deals with activities related to ensuring the quality of the software product.

### Phases in STLC

#### Requirements Analysis:

Understanding and analyzing the software requirements to identify testing needs and establish the testing scope.

#### Test Planning:

Creating a comprehensive test plan that outlines the testing strategy, objectives, scope, resources, schedule, and deliverables.

#### Test Design:

Developing test cases based on the requirements and design specifications. This involves creating detailed test scenarios and test scripts.

#### Test Environment Setup:

Setting up the necessary testing infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network configurations, to execute the test cases.

#### Test Execution:

Executing the test cases and recording the results. This phase involves both functional and non-functional testing, such as performance, security, and usability testing.

#### Defect Reporting and Tracking:

Identifying and documenting defects, if any, and tracking them through resolution.

#### Test Closure:

Evaluating the testing process and summarizing the testing activities. It includes preparing test closure reports and gathering feedback for process improvement.
